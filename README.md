## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
The UI was originally circles instead of rounded squares, I had to research how to get the square look and made a drawable xml file called rounded_square_button to solve this challenge.
The logic of the calculator was also somewhat difficult at times as sometimes I forgot to implement checks to prevent errors such as on division.
